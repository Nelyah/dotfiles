;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides support for hiding and unhiding TeX, LaTeX,
;; ConTeXt, Texinfo and similar macros and environments inside of
;; AUCTeX.
;;
;; Caveats:
;;
;; The display string of content which should display part of itself
;; is made by copying the text from the buffer together with its text
;; properties.  If fontification has not happened when this is done
;; (e.g. because of lazy or just-in-time font locking) the intended
;; fontification will not show up.  Maybe this could be improved by
;; using some sort of "lazy folding" or refreshing the window upon
;; scrolling.  As a workaround fontification of the whole buffer
;; currently is forced before folding it.

  "List of replacement specifiers and macros to fold.

The first element is of the form SPEC or (SPEC . SIG), where SPEC can be
a string, an integer or a function symbol and SIG is described below.
The second element is a list of macros to fold without the leading
backslash.

If SPEC is a string, it will be used as a display replacement for the
whole macro.  Numbers in braces, brackets, parens or angle brackets will
be replaced by the respective macro argument.  For example \"{1}\" will
be replaced by the first mandatory argument of the macro.  One can also
define alternatives within the specifier which are used if an argument
is not found.  Alternatives are separated by \"||\".  They are most
useful with optional arguments.  As an example, the default specifier
for \\item is \"[1]:||*\" which means that if there is an optional
argument, its value is shown followed by a colon.  If there is no
optional argument, only an asterisk is used as the display string.

If SPEC is an integer, the macro will be replaced by the respective
macro argument.

If SPEC is a function symbol, the function will be called with all
mandatory arguments of the macro and the result of the function call
will be used as a replacement for the macro.  Such functions typically
return a string, but may also return the symbol `abort' to indicate that
the macro should not be folded.

SIG optionally restricts how many macro arguments are consumed.  It
should be of the form required by the SIGNATURE argument of
`TeX-find-macro-boundaries'.  For example, if SIGNATURE is an integer n,
then at most n total arguments are consumed, while if it is a cons
cell (p . q), then at most p optional and q mandatory arguments are
allowed.

Setting this variable does not take effect immediately.  Use Customize
or reset the mode."
