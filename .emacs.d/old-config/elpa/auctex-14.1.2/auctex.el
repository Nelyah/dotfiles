;;; Commentary:

;; AUCTeX is an integrated environment for writing input files for TeX,
;; LaTeX, ConTeXt, Texinfo, and docTeX.  The component preview-latex
;; provides true "WYSIWYG" experience in the sourcebuffer.

;;; Code:

;; This can be used for starting up AUCTeX, e.g., when not installed
;; from ELPA.

;; The silly `(when t' test stops performing the `require' during
;; compilation where `load-file-name' is nil and things would go wrong.

  (require 'tex-site
           (expand-file-name "tex-site.el"
                             (file-name-directory load-file-name))))
